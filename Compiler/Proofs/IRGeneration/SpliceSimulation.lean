# Splice simulation (fragment slice 1: atomics, `if`, `block`)

Relates the execution of a lock-release-spliced body to the original body:
results agree exactly, except that frame halts (`return`/`stop`) carry the
lock-released state — which is the intended semantics of
`applyLockReleaseOnExits`.  Built on the fuel-stability API (#2286/#2287).

This slice covers the fragment without `switch` and `for`; `switch` follows
the same shape and is the next extension.
